      <!--<h5>Course Overview</h5>
      
<p>Topics to be covered in this course include: physical, chemical & biological fundamentals that govern the fate and transport of pollutants in the environment, as well as the design of water and wastewater treatment systems; an analysis of engineering design using principles of Green Engineering, and sustainability issues in the developing world.</p>



<p>From Julie Zimmerman:  Topics will range from sources to meet current water needs for human consumption, industry, agriculture, recreation and ecosystem services, and the state of these sources under future scenarios of status quo, global warming, population growth, and the industrialization of developing nations. The course will also cover the fundamentals of water chemistry, the current design of water and wastewater treatment and distribution systems, an analysis of these designs through Green Engineering, and innovations for future designs including providing services without significant infrastructure.</p>-->


<h2>Course Material</h2>
<h5>From the Catalog</h5>
<p>An introduction to the fundamentals of environmental engineering and science such as chemistry, microbiology, mass balance, and reactor theory. Application of fundamental concepts to environmental engineering includes water quality, water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste, air pollution, greenhouse gases and climate change. This course includes hands-on laboratory component with a focus on experiential learning. Prerequisite: ENGR 222 or permission of the instructor.</p>

<h4>Course Overview</h4>
<p>In addition to covering fundamental principles (e.g., from chemistry, microbiology, and fluid mechanics) that govern environmental engineering, this course is also an opportunity for you to look critically at some of humanity's big problems.  Here in the US, we face challenges associated with crumbling, out-of-date civil and environmental engineering infrastructure, and, in certain regions, looming problems of water scarcity. Around the world, 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation (cite UNEP) and, according to WHO, 900 million people lack access to safe drinking water. And to make things even more interesting, climate change is expected to exacerbate many of the these problems.</p>

<p>Over the semester we will examine the current design of water and wastewater treatment systems, analyze these designs within the context of the principles of Green Engineering, and consider innovations for future designs that will provide solutions for regions without existing infrastructure. In addition to applying chemistry, microbiology, and physics to environmental problems, you will have a chance to engage in thoughtful intellectual conversations about current environmental issues both in writing and during in-class discussions. Learning how to talk enthusiastically and intelligently is an important skill you can learn in college, and you will have opportunityies to practice these skills in this class.
</p>

<h5>Exams and Quizzes</h5>
<p>There will be two in class mid-term exams and one cumulative final exam.  Make-up exams will only be available to students with written medical authorization from the Health Center or the Associate Dean of Engineering. <strong>Note that to pass this class your average exam grade must be at least 60%.</strong> In addition, there will be at least ten in-class quizzes, some of which will <strong>not be announced ahead of time</strong>.  The goal of the quizzes is to help you keep up with reading and course work and alert me when important concepts are not clear. Quizzes will be held during the first 5–15 minutes of class (depending on how extensive they are) and there will be no make up quizzes. I will drop your quizz with the lowest score.  Student athletes: please contact me if  anticipate missing more than one class.</p>

<h5>Calculators</h5>
<p>The only calculator models acceptable for use during exams are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Casio: All fx-115 models.  Any Casio calculator must contain fx-115 in its name.</p></li>
  <li><p>Hewlett Packard:  HP33 and HP35 models only.</p></li>
  <li><p>Texas Instruments: All TI-30X and TI-36X models.</p></li> </ul>

<p>Note that the National Council for Engineering and Surveying only allows the same list of calculator models for the FE Exam.</p>


<h5>Homework Policy</h5>
<p>There will be ten problem sets over the semester that will give you the practice which is critical for succeeding on the exams.  I encourage you to work with your classmates on the problem sets, but you must each submit your own work.  In additon, please write the names of people you worked with at the top of each problem. <strong><em>I strongly advise you to actively work through the problem sets. If you don't, you will likely not do very well on exams</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>No late homeworks will be accepted unless you made arrangements with me prior to the due date.</strong></p>

<h5>Blog on summer reading:<em>The Big Necessity: the Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why it Matters</em>, by Rose George.</h5>
<p>I chose this book, because almost all of the chapters remind me how civil and environmental engineers have improved our lives, and, on the other hand, the problems that existing engineering designs don't address.  Instead of asking you to write formal paper, I've set up blog where you will have to opportunity to discuss the book in the form of blog posts.  Take a look at the <a href="/assignments/Big_Necessity_Assign.pdf">full assignment</a> for more details.</p>

<h5>Participation and Professionalism</h5>
<p>Attendance, while not mandatory, is highly recommended, and will contribute to the Participation and Professionalism part of your grade.  In addition to listening to me lecture, you will actively work through problems during class, which should help you with homework, quizzes, and exams.  Additionally, since I am trying to cultivate a learning community in the classroom, <em>I ask that you arrive on time and prepared for class </em>, and that includes completing reading assignments.  I will call on students regularly, but only after I give you time (at least a couple of minutes) to think about a question I pose in class.</p>

<p>If you'd rather be sleeping, texting, facebooking, tweeting, shopping, or gaming, I suggest you do it somewhere more comfortable than the classroom.  I prefer that you don't use laptops, tablets, or cell phones--unless it's helping you work on or solve an in-class problem. </p>
