      <!--<h5>Course Overview</h5>
      
<p>Topics to be covered in this course include: physical, chemical & biological fundamentals that govern the fate and transport of pollutants in the environment, as well as the design of water and wastewater treatment systems; an analysis of engineering design using principles of Green Engineering, and sustainability issues in the developing world.</p>



<p>From Julie Zimmerman:  Topics will range from sources to meet current water needs for human consumption, industry, agriculture, recreation and ecosystem services, and the state of these sources under future scenarios of status quo, global warming, population growth, and the industrialization of developing nations. The course will also cover the fundamentals of water chemistry, the current design of water and wastewater treatment and distribution systems, an analysis of these designs through Green Engineering, and innovations for future designs including providing services without significant infrastructure.</p>-->


<h2>Course Material</h2>
<h5>From the Catalog</h5>
<p>An introduction to the fundamentals of environmental engineering and science such as chemistry, microbiology, mass balance, and reactor theory. Application of fundamental concepts to environmental engineering includes water quality, water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste, air pollution, greenhouse gases and climate change. This course includes hands-on laboratory component with a focus on experiential learning. Prerequisite: ENGR 222 or permission of the instructor.</p>

<h4>Course Overview</h4>
<p>In addition to covering basic fundamental principles that govern environmental engineering,   this course is also an opportunity for you to look critically at some of humanity's big problems.  For example, here in the US, we face challenges associated with crumbling, out-of-date civil and environmental engineering infrastructure, and, in certain regions, looming problems of water scarcity. Around the world, 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation (cite UNEP) and, according to WHO, 900 million people lack access to safe drinking water.  And to make things even more interesting, climate change is expected to exacerbate many of the these problems, as well as introduce new problems (e.g. rising sea level). Over the semester we will look critically at the current design of water and wastewater treatment systems, analyze these designs using the principles of Green Engineering, and consider innovations for future designs that will provide solutions for regions without existing infrastructure. In addition to analyzing environmental problems using mathematical and chemical equations, you will have a chance to engage in thoughtful intellectual conversations about current environmental issues.

<h5>Exams and Quizzes</h5>
<p>There will be two in class preliminary exams and one cumulative final exam.  In addition there will be ten in-class quizzes, which may or may not be announced.  The goal of the quizzes is to help you keep up with reading and course work and alert me when important concepts are not clear.Quizzes will be held during the first 5–15 minutes of class (depending on how extensive they are) and there bill be no make up quizzes. I will drop your quizz with the lowest score. </p>

<h6>Calculators</h6>
The only calculator models acceptable for use during exams are as follows: 
<ul>
  <li><p>Casio: All fx-115 models.  Any Casio calculator must contain fx-115 in its name.</p></li>
  <li><p>Hewlett Packard:  HP33 and HP35 models only.</p></li>
  <li><p>Texas Instruments: All TI-30X and TI-36X models.</p></li> </ul>

<p>Note that the National Council for Engineering and Surveying only allows the same list calculator models for the FE Exam.  Please contact me if you have questions about your calculator.</p>


<h5>Problem Sets</h5>
<p>There will be nine problem sets over the semester that will give you the practice you need to succeed on the exams.  I encourage you to work with your classmates on the problem sets, but you must each submit your own work.  In additon, you need to note at the top of each problem set who you worked with. I strongly advise you to actively work through the problem sets. If you don't, you will likely not do very well on exams.</p>

<h2>Classroom Culture and Professionalism</h2>

<p>If you'd rather be sleeping, messaging your friends, facebooking, tweeting, shopping, or gaming, I suggest you do it somewhere more comfortable than the classroom.  Please don't use laptops, tablets, or cell phones during class (I find it rude and get irritable) unless we need a technology for a specific exercise---Thank you! </p>

<h2>Academic responsibility</h2>

<p>Students are expected to abide by the principles clearly explained in the Student Handbook and to act in accordance with Bucknell University's Honor Code presented below. Under no circumstance, should any student submit work that is not of his or her authorship. If a deadline is tight or impossible, don't get desperate, instead, talk to your me.

In addition, I will explain in detail the collaboration policy for each specific assignment. Before you start your work, make sure to read and understand this policy. Should any questions arise, contact me immediately to have them clarified.</p>

<h3>Bucknell University Honor Code</h3>

<blockquote><p>Bucknell students are responsible for the preparation and presentation of work representing their own efforts. Acceptance
of this responsibility is essential to the educational process and must be considered as an expression of mutual trust, the
foundation upon which creative scholarship rests. Students are directed to use great care when preparing all written work
and to acknowledge fully the source of all ideas and language other than their own.</p>

<p>As a student and citizen of the Bucknell University community:</p>
<ul>
  <li> I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors.</li>
  <li> I will forthrightly oppose each and every instance of academic dishonesty.</li>
  <li> I will let my conscience guide my decision to communicate directly with any person or persons I believe to have been dishonest in academic work.</li>
  <li> I will let my conscience guide my decision on reporting breaches of academic integrity to the appropriate faculty or deans.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<h2>Disability statement</h2>

<p>Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty, and Bucknell's Disability Services. Students who believe they are eligible for accommodations but who have not yet obtained approval should contact the Associate Dean of Engineering, who will pass along any required accomodations.  Refer to <a href: "https://www.bucknell.edu/campus-life/disability-services-and-resources/faqs.html">Bucknell's FAQ about disability services</a> if you have questions, or contact me---by email or in person.  Note that accommodation requests are confidential.</p>
